To clarify, the order was already ceased at both the network and billing levels, and rollback on a ceased order is not supported. No restore request has been received from Sales on the OSO side. For the EDI case, please note that the solution is fully disconnected, so cancellation is not possible.\nWe request your confirmation on the following:\n\nDoes the user intend to restore the disconnected solution?\nor\nProceed with a new EDI solution?\n\nYour confirmation will help us apply the WA and proceed with the correct next steps.\n\nThanks",
