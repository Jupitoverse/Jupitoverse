# Input Directory - Place Your Excel Files Here

## Instructions

1. **Place your Excel file in this directory**
2. **Required columns** in your Excel file:
   - SR ID (or Call ID)
   - Priority (P1/P2/P3/P4)
   - Description (issue description)
   - Semantic Workaround (pre-generated by extract_semantic_workarounds.py)
   - Notes (optional)

3. **File format**: .xlsx or .xls

## Example Excel Structure

| SR ID | Priority | Description | Semantic Workaround | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| SR001 | P1 | Database connection failure | Restart DB service, check connection pool | Connection timeout after 30s |
| SR002 | P2 | NullPointerException in OrderService | Check null validation in OrderService.java | Occurs during peak hours |

## Processing

Once your file is here, run:
```bash
RUN_RAG_PIPELINE.bat
```

The pipeline will:
1. Automatically detect your Excel file
2. Process each SR one by one
3. Generate intelligent analysis
4. Save results to: `DTU MOD/llm output/`

## Notes

- If multiple Excel files are present, the first one will be used
- Ensure all required columns are present
- Empty rows will be skipped automatically
- For best results, run `extract_semantic_workarounds.py` first to generate the Semantic Workaround column
