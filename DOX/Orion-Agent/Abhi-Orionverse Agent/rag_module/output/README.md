## 🧹 Cleanup

Old output files can be cleaned manually or via scheduled job:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

output_dir = Path("output/reports")
cutoff = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=30)

for file in output_dir.glob("*.xlsx"):
    if file.stat().st_mtime < cutoff.timestamp():
        file.unlink()
```

## ⚠️ Notes

- Output files are overwritten if same timestamp
- Large reports may take time to generate
- Keep backups of important reports
- Export files can be safely deleted
